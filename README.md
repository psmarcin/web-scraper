### Idea
This repository contains all I need to run internally CloudFlare Service Worker. It contains both ðŸ“–(infrastructure) and ðŸ’»(code).

### How to run
This example project requires tools:
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - Infrastructure as a code
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Function logic
* [Wrangler](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts/) - Interact with GCP

#### Infrastructure
